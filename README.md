# Javascript-Fundamentals-Quiz

This quiz asks questions to test the Javascript knowledge of the user.

A basic HTML document was created as well as a CSS document. Most of the coding work
is inside of the JS document.

I started by naming the variables I knew I would be using. Then moved onto writing 
Y/N questions about Javascript.

For Loops were created so that the webpage knew what to do if a question was
answered incorrectly.

I used the local storage to record initials and the score of the user.

Event Listeners were added so the webpage is able to target the buttons clicked
and determine if a question was answered correctly or not.

Some styling was added to the file to make the webpage more appealing.
